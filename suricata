Surikata:
Package name: suricata
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
Check /etc/suricata/rules
Check af-packet Change the interface
Search: rule-files
Add new rule - local.rules
 
Alert icmp any any -> any any (msg: “ping detected”; sid: 123; rev: 1;)

SURICATA AS IPS
To run in ips mode we need NFQueue
Suricata –build-info | grep NFQueue 

NFQueue - kernel feature

Goto to suricata.yaml 
/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
And search for nfq
And uncomment 
Mode
Repeat-mark
Repeat-mask
route-queue:2

Check for iptables

Write a rule to redirect icmp packet to NFQueue

Sudo iptables -I INPUT -p icmp -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 2
Sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p icmp -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 2

sudo iptables -L -v 

Inside rules drop icmp any any —--------already written

Stop suricata because it is running in ids mode and we want to run it in ips mode
If it run in ids it will generate both logs of ids and ips

Now ping and check the packets are getting dropped or not according to rule

KEY POINTS:
NFQUEue 
Kernel
